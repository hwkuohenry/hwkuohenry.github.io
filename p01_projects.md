I organized my projects as follows. For more information, please clicks the following links and access to more complete description of each of the projects. 


## Short-and-Sparse Deconvolution ##

<table>
	<col width="25%">
	<col width="75%">
	<tr>
    	<td> <a href="https://sbdsphere.github.io"><img src="/assets/fig_realdata_rec.png" > </a> </td>
    	<td >  Datasets in many areas can be effectively expressed as convolution of a <b> short </b> pattern and <b> sparse </b> map represents occurrences of the pattern. We study an algorithm for solving <a href="https://sbdsphere.github.io"> deconvolution of short-and-sparse signal</a>, providing a theoretical understanding and general purposed computational method. </td>
  	</tr>
</table>



## Microscope with Line Probe ##

                   
<table>
	<col width="25%">
	<col width="75%">
	<tr>
    	<td> <a href="https://google.com"><img src="/assets/fig_probe_closeup2.png" > </a> </td>
    	<td>We study the use of <a href="https://google.com"> line probe in microscopy </a> for structured signal. Unlike conventional point probe, the line probe measurement is accumulated electric current between the contact surface of the line shaped probe and sample, and is <b> delocalized </b> and hence more <b>efficient</b>.</td>
