My involved projectes are organized as follows. For more information, please clicks the following links accessing to dedicated web pages in which  we elaborate each of the projects in details. 


## [Short-and-Sparse Deconvolution](https://deconvlab.github.io) ##

<table>

    	<td >  Datasets in many areas can be effectively expressed as convolution of a <b> short </b> pattern and <b> sparse </b> map represents occurrences of the pattern. We study an algorithm for solving <a href="https://deconvlab.github.io"> deconvolution of short-and-sparse signal</a>, providing a theoretical understanding and general purposed computational method. </td>

## [Microscope with Line Probe](/pages/intro_clp) ##

	<col width="75%">
	<tr>
    	<td> <a href="/pages/intro_clp"><img src="/assets/fig_probe_closeup2.png" > </a> </td>
    	<td>We study the use of <a href="/pages/intro_clp"> line probe in microscopy </a> for structured signal. Unlike conventional point probe, a single line probe measurement is the accumulated electric current between the contact surface of the line shaped probe and sample. The line probe measurements are <b> delocalized </b> and hence more <b>efficient</b>.</td>
